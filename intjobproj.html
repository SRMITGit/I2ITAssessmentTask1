				<p><strong>Q1. What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>
				<p>I’m interested in IT because of its capacity to change so quickly in extraordinary ways. I have been interested in IT from a very young age and really began after watching some classic science fiction shows like Red Dwarf, Doctor Who, and
					Blake’s Seven. After seeing the computers in those shows, I started building my own and over my working life have been lucky enough to hold positions working on database development, website design, and systems administration.</p>
				<p><strong>Q2. Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>
				<p>I chose the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University (RMIT) because the course it offered was perfect for all of my needs and as an added bonus, it is a world class, highly ranked university.</p>
				<p><strong>Q3. What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>
				<p>My aspirations for taking this course is to gain the knowledge to develop practical applications for the ever increasing power of our tech. What I expect to learn during this course is how to take an idea from concept to completion,
					including the development of the code, the design of the UI, and the building of the machine to run the software.</p>

				<h2>Li-Fi Systems For Cafes</h2>
				<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
				<p>This system will be a customisable lighting system for cafes to deliver their Internet access over Li-Fi (light Wi-Fi) to their customers. The system has the potential to deliver uninterrupted, high speed, secure Internet access whilst the
					customers enjoy a meal or beverage. The customisable lighting system will allow café owners to outfit their spaces using their original lighting layout or additional lamps for specific areas. The cafe owners will have the ability to control
					access to their Internet connection simply by turning off a light or by using a dedicated button to only turn off the Li-Fi capabilities of the light.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Motivation</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Café culture plays an important role in today’s always-online-society and with the ever increasing demand to be constantly connected, the safety of this connection should be something that is built in to every device. When sitting at a café
					enjoying your best life, using the free Internet access, you shouldn’t have to worry about some nefarious character intercepting your communication. Global cybersecurity company Kaspersky suggests the biggest threat to free Wi-Fi security
					is the ability for the hacker to position themselves between you and the connection point. Allowing the hacker to access to every piece of information you're sending out on the Internet<sup>[1]</sup>. Free public Wi-Fi networks usually have
					poor security features but by using this customisable Li-Fi system, better security measures like geofencing<sup>[3]</sup> can be automatically added for each connection quickly and easily and once you leave the light, your access will be
					conveniently switched off.
