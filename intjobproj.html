							<p><strong>Q1. What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>
							<p>I’m interested in IT because of its capacity to change so quickly in extraordinary ways.  I have been interested in IT from a very young age and really began after watching some classic science fiction shows like Red Dwarf, Doctor Who, and Blake’s Seven.  After seeing the computers in those shows, I started building my own and over my working life have been lucky enough to hold positions working on database development, website design, and systems administration.</p>
							<p><strong>Q2. Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>
							<p>I chose the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University (RMIT) because the course it offered was a perfect for all of my needs and as an added bonus, it is a world class, highly ranked university.</p>
							<p><strong>Q3. What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>
							<p>My aspirations for taking this course is to gain the knowledge to develop practical applications for the ever increasing power of our tech.  What I expect to learn during this course is how to take an idea from concept to completion, including the development of the code, the design of the UI, and the building of the machine to run the software.</p>
