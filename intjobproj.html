				<p><strong>Q1. What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong></p>
				<p>I’m interested in IT because of its capacity to change so quickly in extraordinary ways. I have been interested in IT from a very young age and really began after watching some classic science fiction shows like Red Dwarf, Doctor Who, and
					Blake’s Seven. After seeing the computers in those shows, I started building my own and over my working life have been lucky enough to hold positions working on database development, website design, and systems administration.</p>
				<p><strong>Q2. Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>
				<p>I chose the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University (RMIT) because the course it offered was perfect for all of my needs and as an added bonus, it is a world class, highly ranked university.</p>
				<p><strong>Q3. What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>
				<p>My aspirations for taking this course is to gain the knowledge to develop practical applications for the ever increasing power of our tech. What I expect to learn during this course is how to take an idea from concept to completion,
					including the development of the code, the design of the UI, and the building of the machine to run the software.</p>

				<h2>Li-Fi Systems For Cafes</h2>
				<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
				<p>
					This system will be a customisable lighting system for cafes to deliver their Internet access over Li-Fi (light fidelity) to their customers. The system has the potential to deliver uninterrupted, high speed, secure Internet access whilst
					the customers enjoy a meal or beverage. The customisable lighting system will allow café owners to outfit their spaces using their original lighting layout or additional lamps for specific areas. The cafe owners will have the ability to
					control access to their Internet connection simply by turning off a light or by using a dedicated button to only turn off the Li-Fi capabilities of the network.
					<p>
						<strong>Motivation</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Café culture plays an important role in today’s always-online-society and with the ever increasing demand to be constantly connected, the safety of this connection should be something that is built in to every device. When sitting at a
						café enjoying your best life, using the free Internet access, you shouldn’t have to worry about some nefarious character intercepting your communication. Global cybersecurity company Kaspersky suggests the biggest threat to free Wi-Fi
						security is the ability for the hacker to position themselves between you and the connection point. Allowing the hacker to access to every piece of information you're sending out on the Internet <sup>[1]</sup>. Free public Wi-Fi networks usually
						have poor security features but by using this customisable Li-Fi system, better security measures like geofencing <sup>[2]</sup> can be automatically added for each connection quickly and easily and once you leave the light, your access will be
						conveniently switched off.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Description</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Li-Fi technology is a high speed bi-directional network for mobile communication of data using light. A Li-Fi system is comprised of multiple LED bulbs that form a wireless network for illumination and data transmission utilising visible
						light communication (VLC) technology. Data is transmitted by the flickering of the LEDs from on and off states at a very high rate that is imperceptible to the human eye. Essentially, the ‘on state’ represents a binary 1 and the ‘off
						state’ represents a binary 0 so the faster the LED can perform this action, the faster the data transmission speeds will be. With more LEDs in the Li-Fi system, more data can be transmitted over the network. Wi-Fi technology relies on radio
						waves which cover a frequency spectrum of 30 Hz to 300 GHz and although current technology is heading towards 5 GHz networks, there are significant limitations to it. 5 GHz networks do not penetrate solid objects such as walls nearly as well as
						do 2.4 GHz signals so although the higher frequency offers higher transmission speeds, it does not necessarily mean faster connections for the end user <sup>[3]</sup>. Using VLC technology, the frequency spectrum is 10,000 times larger covering 430
						to 790 THz which will allow for significantly higher data transmission speeds <sup>[4]</sup>. Li-Fi will offer fast, reliable, and safe Internet access for the cafe and its customers through this customisable lighting system.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Tools and Technologies</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The products supplied to the cafe will include, simple to use software that allows the cafe owner full control over their Li-Fi network through a smartphone app or desktop environment, high quality eco-friendly LEDs and a specially
						designed set of light switches to allow for the Internet to be turned off but the lights to remain on, and small, non-invasive devices for each access point that contain a Li-Fi enabled component with an application-specific integrated circuit
						(ASIC) <sup>[5]</sup>.

						The smartphone app will be able to control a range of lighting situations from simple dimming, colour changes of individual lights connected to the network, and alerts when an LED needs changing. It will also give the user full control
						over the Li-Fi network with useful analytics like data usage, transfer speeds, and energy consumption. The smartphone app will be available for both Android and iOS devices. The desktop application will be a reflection of the smartphone app to
						allow for an ease of use when switching between the two.

						The Li-Fi enabled LEDs will replace all of the existing lights in the cafe in order to connect to the Li-Fi network. They have standard fittings so only the bulb will need changing and not the bulb housing and as the connectivity to the
						network relies on visible light communication, tests will be carried out throughout the café to ensure the best coverage. The specially designed set of light switches will easily replace the current set of light switches and allow the
						user to power on or off the Li-Fi enabled LEDs, with or without network connectivity. They will also give the user the ability to dim or brighten individual lights. Only the smartphone app and desktop application will allow the user to change
						the colour of the lights.

						The number of small, non-invasive devices containing a photodetector, amplifier and Li-Fi enabled ASIC, will depend on the number of access points the café requires and will be installed on each access point so as not to interfere with
						the daily activities of a busy cafe. This device is required to allow customers to connect to the Li-Fi network because at the time of writing this report, Li-Fi communication is an emerging technology and the devices with a Li-Fi enabled
						functionality preinstalled have not yet reached the mainstream. This should not be seen as a limitation because this device can be designed to suit the individual and also programmed to perform other functions such as simple orders or
						cashless payments.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Skills Required</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The programming skills require for the successful completion and delivery of this project include:
						<ul>
							<li>App coding knowledge for both Android and iOS environments (XCode, Swift, and Java) </li>
							<li>UX design knowledge for these apps </li>
							<li>Desktop coding knowledge for different operating systems (Java, Python, Objective-C, C, C++). </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						The hardware requirements for this project include:
						<ul>
							<li>High quality LEDs </li>
							<li>Small Li-Fi devices with a dedicated Li-Fi ASIC installed to enable network access </li>
							<li>
								Custom designed light switches for controlling the on, off, and dimming features of the LEDs.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						The feasibility of this project is high as the necessary skills required for its completion are covered within this degree. Over the course of this degree I will learn the programming skills required to develop the software and control
						the hardware.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Outcome</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						If this project is successful, it will allow café customers to enjoy a convenient, reliable, and secure space to stay connected through the power of the custom designed lighting system. As Li-Fi is an emerging technology the success of
						this project would hopefully promote its wider adoption and further development into mainstream products.
